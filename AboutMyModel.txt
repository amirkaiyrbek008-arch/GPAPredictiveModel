P.S. In order not to bother with this installation and use, I think it would be better for me to show a video of its use. Write to me on Telegram and I will send the video as soon as possible: @SalReI | +77019780060

To call, you need to download the disnake library (pip install -U disnake). After that, you need to create an empty bot through the website: https://discord.com/developers/applications
After creation, you need to take the bot token and paste it into bot.run("TOKEN")
Run the Python file through the console

How my model works:

After starting the bot, the student must enter the /menus command. The student will have 7 buttons: Participation, Assignments, Quiz, Mid-Term Test, Final, Credits, Calculate. The first five buttons are for entering data. The sixth button enters the credit for the subject. Calculate calculates the estimated GPA for the discipline. 
To work properly, student must fill the available data starting from the start(left to right).
